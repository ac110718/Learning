## Chapter 1

Big part of search is about understanding user intent

Relevance is the art of ranking content for a search based on how much that content satisfies the needs of the user and the business:
- What content are you searching across? What types of searches (shopping vs. library card catalog)? What optimization metrics (views? Money?)
- Relevance informed heavily by user metrics

Easily tricked into seeing search as a single problem. However, application has its own unique definition of relevance.. For example Google realized relevance for the web depended on trust, not just text. 

E-commerce sites control content being searched so what matters more is affordability and highly rated products. Also need to generate profit, clear expiring inventory, and meetin supplier relationships. Search becomes the e-commerce site's salesperson. The same priorities that matter to the in-store sales experience must be programmed into the e-commerce search 

For expert search, relevant means carefully linking subjects and topics between search queries and content (what are similar topics)

Users come to search engine with great deal of baggage attached (additional data, geolocation), but also bagge is implied in the promises made by the search application. Research requires precision, casual wants recommendations

Features drive decisions. Much engineering work is in feature selection. When performing classification, you identify new features of your data to make better classification decisions. These features also help search solutions make definitive decisions about data. Signals need to correspond to decision space over which search is being performed. Curation (manipulation of content) also matters a lot in surfacing the most helpful and relevant search output.
